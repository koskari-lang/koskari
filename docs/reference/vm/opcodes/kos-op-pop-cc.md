# KOS_OP_POP_CC
- **Style**: NOARG.
- **Stack**: Pops CC block from dynamic chain. When the captured continuation
  is invoked, the VM jumps *to* this opcode with the invoked value (or values)
  on the stack; this opcode then runs (pops the CC block) and execution
  continues at the next instruction (the PUSH_CC resume target).
- **Example:** In the PUSH_CC table above, POP_CC at index 4 is the jump target
  when the continuation is invoked; stack holds the value(s) passed to the
  continuation; after POP_CC, execution continues at index 5 (resume).
