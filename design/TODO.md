# Koskari design TODO

Centralized list of open design and implementation work. See the referenced
design docs for detail.

---

## Continuations / transfer plans

### Interrupted transfer plans

Interrupted transfer plans are not wired in yet. When a transfer plan is
interrupted (e.g. by an exception or a new transfer being triggered), resumption
should use `kos_build_direct_install_plan` to rebuild or complete the plan; this
path is not yet connected.

Ref: `koskari/lib/dynchain.c` — `kos_build_direct_install_plan`;
[EVALUATOR.md](EVALUATOR.md) (transfer plans, revive_plan);
[interpreter/callcc.md](interpreter/callcc.md) (continuation invoke, plan build).

---

## Evaluator performance

### Fast local stack

Explore a fast local stack (or stack layout) to speed up the evaluator (C-local
eval state, freeze/thaw; see the design note). The compiler already performs
reducible constant folding, instruction peephole rewrites in `compress`, and
VAR→FAST lowering in `Compiler.complete`; a separate fast operand stack in the
VM remains open.

Ref: [interpreter/freeze-thaw-context-segments.md](interpreter/freeze-thaw-context-segments.md).

---

## Profiling / instrumentation

### Profiling compile-time options and runtime hooks

**Status:** Freelist tracing, **`KOS_TRACE_EVENTS`** (VM/dynchain counters via
`get_trace_report()["events"]`), and **`KOS_TRACE_TIMING`** (per-opcode and
post-handler timing) are implemented. Remaining work: optional opcode-level
histograms.

Ref: [api/tracing.md](api/tracing.md).

---

## Compiler

### Slice atom and slice syntax

Bring over Python-sibilant slicing support in both forms:

- **Slice atom form** — a first-class slice object form (atom-level) that can be
  used in expression trees and lowered consistently.
- **Slice surface syntax** — reader/compiler support for bracket slicing syntax
  (start/stop/step variants) so user code can write slices directly.

Ref: [archive/compiler-python-sibilant-historical.md](archive/compiler-python-sibilant-historical.md) § To Migrate.

### Fenced foreign literal

Add a compile-time fenced foreign-literal mechanism: the reader recognizes
triple-backtick fence syntax and lowers it to `compile/apply-fence`; that
special resolves a handler (e.g. `fence/json`) which transliterates raw fenced
source into Koskari source. V1 scope is reader support, the special, metadata
plumbing, and one built-in JSON fence with narrow extensions (bare identifiers
in value position only).

Ref: [fenced-foreign-literal.md](fenced-foreign-literal.md).

### Bundles and namespace facets

Introduce **bundles** as first-class namespace facet objects: a namespace of
implementation bindings, an exports list, and a scoped activation mechanism
(e.g. `with-bundle`). Exports act as forwarding facades that activate the
bundle and redispatch to bundle-local implementations. Bundles participate in
both compile-time resolution (specials, operators, fence/layout handlers) and
runtime name lookup, so features can ship as cohesive namespaces without
polluting the module.

Ref: [bundles-and-namespace-facets.md](bundles-and-namespace-facets.md).

### Self-hosted compiler and bootstrap (roadmap)

**Status:** Design only; phased implementation.

Split the Python compiler into a **bootstrap** package, reimplement the
compiler in **`.ki`**, compile to **`.kio`** with the bootstrap stack, then
recompile with **loaded `.kio`** (stage0 → final) and verify fixpoint. Native
**C** VM and a **thin Python** host layer remain; see the doc for package
layout, two-pass build, and ordered steps.

Ref: [self-hosted-compiler-bootstrap.md](self-hosted-compiler-bootstrap.md);
[interpreter/kio-format.md](interpreter/kio-format.md) (`.kio` format);
`koskari.serialize` (incremental compile and `dump_kio`).

---

## Import / loader

### Python AST loader (transformative parser)

Load Python modules as Koskari modules at import time by using a special reader
that transforms Python AST into equivalent Koskari expression trees; the
existing Compiler and specials consume those forms unchanged. The new piece is
the transformative parser (AST → form tree); no compiler or special-form
changes required.

Ref: [python-ast-loader.md](python-ast-loader.md); [api/import-system.md](api/import-system.md) (module lifecycle, load path).

### .kio compiled cache

Implementation exists under `koskari.serialize` (read/write sectioned `.kio`,
incremental compile from `.ki`). Loader integration and packaging follow the
self-hosting roadmap.

Ref: [interpreter/kio-format.md](interpreter/kio-format.md);
[self-hosted-compiler-bootstrap.md](self-hosted-compiler-bootstrap.md);
[api/import-system.md](api/import-system.md).

### Import path selection

Add a feature flag (e.g. environment variable or loader knob) to choose at
runtime between demand imports and run_sync imports, instead of editing
`exec_module` in code.

Ref: [ideas.md](ideas.md); [api/import-system.md](api/import-system.md) (async vs demand path).

---

## Builtins

### CLI startup version banner and --version

Add Python version, platform, and Koskari version to the Koskari CLI startup
banner. Also add a `--version` parameter that prints the same version/platform
information and exits.

---

## User documentation

### Bootstrap human-facing docs from meta spec

Create a top-level `docs/` tree (or external site) using the information
architecture, audiences, and maintenance rules in the documentation goals
meta-document (two on-ramps, shared guide, reference, VM/opcode tier,
patterns, contributor pages).

Ref: [documentation-goals.md](documentation-goals.md).

## To design (broader)

From [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md) and related docs:

- Performance optimizations (general)

## Recorded proposals (evaluate / implement)

The following items are captured from design discussion. Each has a short
design note and is open for evaluation and possible implementation.

### Seq-values kwargs (in-scope formals apply)

**TODO:** Specify bytecode and runtime surfaces for kwargs-capable seq-values /
in-scope formals apply; implement and test standalone, then consume from
runtime match and from `define-values` / `setq-values` kwargs paths.

Ref: [language/seq-values-kwargs-formals-apply.md](language/seq-values-kwargs-formals-apply.md).

### Runtime `match` form, `match/case` layout, and `MATCH_CASE` lowering

**TODO:** Reader layout, compile lowering per arm, opcode applier (analogous to
`SWITCH_EQ`), constant pools with extern names from local env, and
syntax-rules-style namespace mapping for committed arms; depends on seq-values
kwargs foundation where arm binding requires it.

Ref: [language/match-case-form.md](language/match-case-form.md).

### `RETURN` frame-only; `return-shift` for delim continuations

**TODO:** Split ordinary return from delimited-continuation rebound: `RETURN`
handles frame boundary only; introduce explicit `return-shift` (name TBD) for
the delim case; migrate any bundled behavior off `RETURN`.

Ref: [interpreter/return-return-shift.md](interpreter/return-return-shift.md).

### Destructuring formals, referencing formals, `define-values` fork

**TODO:** Nested patterns in lambda formals (e.g. `(lambda [a (b c) *: d] …)`);
`(ref …)` formals for rebind-to-Ref and write-through `set!`; if destructuring
and refs cannot share one formals grammar, limit unpacking to `define-values` /
`setq-values` with kwargs only (no ref binding there — refs stay on formals).

Ref:
[language/destructuring-and-referencing-formals.md](language/destructuring-and-referencing-formals.md).

### Multi-dispatch methods (matchers on formals)

**TODO:** Method tables dispatched by type/value/shape matchers over formals,
structured like `define-special` but feeding **runtime sequence values** into
the matcher arms instead of source forms.

Ref: [language/multi-dispatch-methods.md](language/multi-dispatch-methods.md).

### Example dispatch call timing harness

**TODO:** Add timed examples (Python, async Python, Koskari, demand Koskari
callees; Python and Koskari callers); triple timestamps with baseline
subtraction; ~1000 iterations per cell; aggregate averages.

Ref: [examples/dispatch-call-timing.md](examples/dispatch-call-timing.md).
